Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.

Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"

---------
A B = S C
---------
0 0 = 0 0
0 1 = 1 0
1 0 = 1 0
1 1 = 1 1






























Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:

The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.
Example:

Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]























Given two strings s and t, determine if they are both one edit distance apart.

Note:

There are 3 possiblities to satisify one edit distance apart:

Insert a character into s to get t
Delete a character from s to get t
Replace a character of s to get t
Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cab", t = "ad"
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.
Example 3:

Input: s = "1203", t = "1213"
Output: true
Explanation: We can replace '0' with '1' to get t.

class Solution:
    def isOneEditDistance(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:

Validate IP Address
  Go to Discuss
Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.

IPv4 addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."),
e.g.,172.16.254.1;

Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address 172.16.254.01 is invalid.

IPv6 addresses are represented as

eight groups

 of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits.

The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example,
the address
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid one.
Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so
2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334 is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).

However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity.
For example, 2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334 is an invalid IPv6 address.

Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address
02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is invalid.

Note: You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.

Example 1:
Input: "172.16.254.1"

Output: "IPv4"

Explanation: This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".


Example 2:
Input: "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"

Output: "IPv6"

Explanation: This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".

Example 3:

Input: "256.256.256.256"

Output: "Neither"

Explanation: This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.

Valid Palindrome
  Go to Discuss
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: "race a car"
Output: false
